Installation Instructions
=========================

Overview
--------

1.  Install yaml-cpp in a directory parallel to this one.

2.  Build src-liberty_parse-2.6.

3.  Compile dctk.

Details
-------

$DIR = the directory of dctk download.

yaml-cpp:

  Download yaml-cpp in a directory parallel this one:

    cd $DIR/..

    git clone https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp.git

  To build it using standard cmake build process:

    cd $DIR/../cpp-yaml
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

src-liberty_parse-2.6:

  First set the CFLAGS to skip no-return-type errors.  It is
  needed for most modern versions of compilers:

    setenv CFLAGS -Wno-return-type

  Then go through the standard configure build process:

    cd $DIR/src-liberty_parse-2.6
    ./configure
    make

  Finally, dctk requires static libraries.  Run the custom library
  archiving script in the directory:

    makelib

  The result should be a file named liblibparse.a in the src-liberty_parse-2.6
  directory.

dctk:

  Go through the standard process for cmake:

    cd $DIR
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..

  The result should be build/delay_calc_tool executable

  Test this executable:

    cd $DIR/test
    ./runme

  The results should be a list of all the cells in the library, followed by
  something that looks like:

Reading Test Circuits file test.circuits.yaml
Generating spice netlists for test.circuits.yaml
Processing 2 circuits.
Name = first
Voltage Source = vs1
Driver = and/a/y
Driver Interconnect = 1.1 100 1.1
Load = or/a/y
load_interconnect = 2.2 200 2.2
----------
Name = second
Voltage Source = vs2
Driver = nand/a/y
Driver Interconnect = 3.1 300 3.1
Load = nor/a/y
load_interconnect = 4.2 400 5.2
----------
Computing Delays for 2 circuits.
