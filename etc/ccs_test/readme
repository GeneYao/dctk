ccs_test.py is a small python program to simulate a current source 
driving an output RC net.

The RC net is given in a simplistic format:

isrc 1 0 time1 value1 time2 value2 time3 value3 ...
res node1 node2 value
cap node1 node2 value

where isrc, res and cap are keywords, node1, node2, etc are all contiguous 
integer numbers, 0 is ground, 1 is the driver output node
The waveform at node 1 is returned and printed

to invoke the program do:
python ccs_test.py  <ckt_file> <integration_time_step>
python ccs_test.py test_ckt1.ckt 0.1e-9
