Delay Calculation ToolKit

This toolkit is currently used to house the files for the TAU 2020 contest.

Please look in INSTALL.txt for installation and testing directions.

Look at the routine compute_delays() in src-dut/delay_calculator.cpp
and its call in src/delay_calc_tool.cpp to see what the API is
expected to look like.

Contestants are expected to provide either a link-able library with
this routine or source code from which it can be created.
